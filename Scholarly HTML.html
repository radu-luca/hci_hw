        QOC 1: Where do I place product images ?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Question </b>: Where do I place product images ?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1 </b> : Top left of the page
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2 </b> : Top right of the page
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Criteria 1</b> : Easy to read and capture the user's attention because we are used to reading from left to
        right
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Criteria 2</b> : Low user effort for the user to find the images of a product being one of the main reasons
        when accessing the page
      </p>
      <p>
        For option number 1 as a positive assessment are both criteria 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for option number 2 as a positive assessment is criteria number 2 but as a negative assessment criteria
        number 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I chose option number 1 to represent the product images at the top left of the page.

        <b>Question </b>: What information about the seller should I display on the product page?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1 </b> : Username of the seller with a link to the profile page
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2 </b> : Username of the seller with a link to the profile page, profile picture, user rating and a
        short description of the user's skills
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Criteria 1</b> : Screen compactness
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Criteria 2</b> : Low user effort to find information about who sells the product without leaving the product
        page
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Criteria 3</b> : Due to the displayed user rating, the credibility of the buyer increases, so it is closer to
        the next step - to buy the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        For option number 1 as a positive assessment are criteria 2 and 3 and respectively as a negative assessment
        criteria 1.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1 </b> : Similar products

    <h3>Interaction Design Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      An interaction design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly-occurring usability problem in
      interface design or interaction design.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the following interaction design patterns I will specify what the problem is, the solution, when to use it and examples based on my application.
    </p>
    <section id="id1">
      <h3>
        Lazy Registration
      </h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> Many users when they arrive on the site are not interested in going through the whole registration process just to have access to the information provided by the developer so they may leave the application before they know what it offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Solution: </b>This design pattern allows the user to access the information provided by the application and when it is only absolutely necessary to register
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When to use: </b> Use this design pattern when you don't give visitors access to sensitive information or when you don't need to know the user's information to interact with the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>About my application: </b> In my application any visitor can access the product pages can see the profile of the sellers and pages such as about us, contact us etc. The user is obliged to register when he wants to buy a product or when he wants to become a seller to place products on the site.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="id1">
      <h3>
        Clear Primary Actions
      </h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> Many users when they are on a page that requires action on their part do not know what to do next and need buttons clearly highlighted with the name of the action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Solution: </b>Create the button design so that it stands out to suggest to the user what action to take.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When to use: </b> It is used whenever a form is completed and an action is to be interpreted. For example, submit a form.</p>
      <p>
        <b>About my application: </b>  In my web application I highlighted the buttons when you submit a form or when you are on a product page and the next step is to click on the "Buy now" button that is highlighted.</p>

      </section>
    <section id="id1">
      <h3>
        Dark Patterns
      </h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> They are used to force an action that the user has preset at the beginning. For example, the newsletter subscription button is checked when you register, but it can be unchecked at any time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Solution: </b> Dark patterns are widely used in e-commerce platforms to lead or trick users into performing certain actions. To use dark patterns responsibly, you must be ethical and have empathy with your users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When to use: </b> When you recommend an action to the user to take it but also give him free choice.
        <p>
        <b>About my application: </b>In my application I will use it to check the mail subscription box in order to get as large an email base as possible and then to create a relationship with my users to turn them into customers.
        <small>It needs to be implemented in the future</small> 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="id1">
      <h3>
        Subscription Plans
      </h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> The users of the application can be classified in different categories and in order to differentiate them, they offer them subscription plans (including sign up). 
        <p>
        <b>Solution: </b> Offer users an options menu for joining at certain rates or free.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to use: </b> When your application can clearly classify users into at least 2 categories.
        <p>
        <b>About my application:</b> My classic application users in 3 categories: visitors, customers and sellers. To be a user you have to register and to become a seller you need to make a request that must be approved by the administrator.

      <h3>
        Gallery 
      </h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> The user needs to browse a collection of high quality images
        <p>
        <b>Solution: </b> A gallery consists of multiple images that can be browsed one by one by navigating between them. Only one image is viewed at a time</p>
      <p>
        <b>When to use: </b> Use when the user needs to browse through a series of images in a sequential way.
        <p>
        <b>About my application:</b> We used Gallery Design Pattern when users visit a product page to access a series of images with that product.

        Crudu Angel is a 10-year-old former entrepreneur who runs a successful business. Being an older person, surfing the internet is not his strong point. Angel has decided to expand his online business and needs services to run a shopify online store. The cost of such a service is high due to the level of difficulty and responsibility. Once Angel has reached the service purchase platform he would like to get as much information as possible about that service, who sells it and how the process goes. He has all the time in the world to analyze and his experience tells him to take the time to check every detail.
